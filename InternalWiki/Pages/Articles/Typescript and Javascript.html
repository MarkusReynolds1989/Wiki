Typescript and Javascript
<p>
    Where to even start with this? These scripting languages can be said to be rough around the edges at best.
    I have so many stories of working on some script for a client or in college where a weird error was
    happening but the interpreter just rolled with the punches and didn't try to stop for the error.
</p>
<p>
    When I started this project I was using javascript/typescript for the front end stuff. But in the end I
    realized that this was terrible, there are too many instances where it can fail and you don't actually
    need it.

    Here is the original ModifyArticle class I had implemented in typescript so I could modify an article:
</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-typescript">
class ModifyArticle {
    readonly titleID: string;
    readonly contentID: string;
    readonly buttonsID: string;
    readonly tagsID: string;
    //Where to the put the editor.
    readonly editorID: string;

    constructor(tiID: string
        , conID: string
        , butID: string
        , tagID: string
        , ediID: string) {
        this.titleID = tiID;
        this.contentID = conID;
        this.buttonsID = butID;
        this.tagsID = tagID;
        this.editorID = ediID;
    }

    public EditArticle(): void {
        this.HideTags()
        this.InsertEditor();
    }

    //Hide all the original elements on the page so we can write over them.
    private HideTags(): void {
        let title: HTMLElement = document.getElementById(this.titleID);
        let content: HTMLElement = document.getElementById(this.contentID);
        let tags: HTMLElement = document.getElementById(this.tagsID);
        let button: HTMLElement = document.getElementById(this.buttonsID);
        title.style.display = "none";
        content.style.display = "none";
        tags.style.display = "none";
        button.style.display = "none";
    }

    //Insert HTML to represent editor and add the get strings to them.
    private InsertEditor(): void {
        let title = this.GetTitle();
        let content = this.GetContent();
        let tags = this.GetTags();
        document.getElementById(this.editorID).innerHTML =
            // TODO: Find out why this is broken. Producing a 400 error. Client side problem.
            //A long modify form here.
    
        let initContent: HTMLElement = document.getElementById("newContent");
        (initContent).value += content;
    }

    // Return the text of the title.
    private GetTitle = (): string =>
        document.getElementById(this.titleID).innerHTML;

    // Return the text of the content.
    private GetContent = (): string =>
        document.getElementById(this.contentID).innerHTML;

    private GetTags = (): string =>
        document.getElementById(this.contentID).innerHTML;
    }
</code>
</pre>
</p>

    So this class is absolutely huge and all it does is modify the DOM. Many would say I should use a
    framework to do this, but I don't have time to learn frameworks. So the solution here, for me at least, is
    to not use Javascript except when I really need client side functionality, like in my modify box where I
    need to implement a button action. I will not use it for modifying html at all.
</p>
<p>
    Why would I abandon modifying the DOM? Well, the problem is that javascript and typescript don't emit
    errors, as I said above. If I were programming in C# or C or pretty much any other language I would get a
    compiler error and it would tell me what I was doing wrong, or at least a close hint. This was my same
    issue with PHP. I need the compilers help to get better and to catch weird mistakes I make.
</p>

    Typescript is much better than Javascript but you have to run a transpiler and there's still room for
    error. The best bet is to just not use it unless you absolutely have to, hopefully webassembly will fix
    most of these issues and I can just write my front end in C#.
