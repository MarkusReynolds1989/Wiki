Lisp
<p>
    Lisp is the type of language that is easy to learn but difficult to master. It's also quite hard to
    learn as a third or fourth language. It never become very popular but it inspired most of the high
    level languages we use today.
</p>
<p>
    Most popular languages marry C's syntax with Lisp's garbage collection, lambda functions, and list
    manipulation. Lynq in C# is example of such an implementation, as well as anonymous function abilities
    it's picked up over the years.
</p>
<p>
    One of the great things about lisp is that things that get parsed in the language are also data types
    called symbols. That means it's very easy to write a compiler in it as it naturally can read itself
    quite well
</p>
<p>
    I could write a hello-world example here but that would be quite boring, instead I'd like to write a
    simple function that adds 1 to a list of items
</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-lisp">
(setf items '(1 2 3 4))

(mapcar (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) items)

(2 3 4 5)
</code>
</pre>
<p> 
    You can actually open up a terminal, throw that info in there, and then watch it run through compilers
    like SBCL. Lisp, like Python, can run dynamically but it can also be compiled down to machine
    code. 
</p>
<p> 
    One further comment I'd like to make is that Lisp also has powerful meta-programming capacities called
    "macros" these tools can allow you to write code that writes code.
