F#
<p>
    F# is a great language for functional programming.
    It combines functional programming concepts with terse readable syntax.
    Here's a very simple hello world function in F#
</p>


<pre>
<code>
 printfn "Hello World!"
</code>
</pre>
<samp>Output: Hello World!</samp>

<p>
    Of course, this is much too simple, we need a much more interesting example. Something F# excels in is
    recursion, here's an example of a recursive function:
<pre>
<code class="language-F#">
//Get the count of the list.
let rec getCount (list, count) =
    match list with
    | [] -> count
    | _ -> getCount (list.Tail, count + 1)
</code>
</pre>
<samp>
    Consumes a list and returns the count of that list.
</samp>
</p>


<p>
    This function gets the count of a list you pass in. One thing to take notice of is the "list.Tail"
    function which gives you the list minus the first element.
</p>
