C Lang
<p> Here is the first page of some information about the C language. I can't guarantee this will expand
    out at all , but, for now this is just the beginning and we can always program a way to move
    everything to the right spot later.

<pre>        
    <code class="language-c">
             /* A simple hello world program in C */
             #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
             #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
             int32_t main() {
                printf("Hello, World!\n");
                return 0;
            }
    </code>
</pre>
<samp>
    Output: Hello,World!

    C is a great and simple language. It's lighting fast to compile, and allows you to do almost anything
    you want in it. That means it allows you to make as many mistakes as you want. I will write more about
    C in later pages.
